             <p>Our platform works to ensure that you get the best out of our customers. We are therefore working to ensure that you get the
             best out of the large number of customers who would wish to travel at their time of convenience. A sacco using our application
             will have so many advantages which makes you eligible to register to use the service.</p>
             <p>The following are the requirements to be able to get your sacco approved on our platform.</p>
             <ol>
                 <li>Valid Sacco Registration Certificate</li>
                 <li>Operational paybill number</li>
                 <li>Dedicated stage in every town that the sacco operates.</li>
             </ol>
             <p>Our application is entirely on cashless payments and is the main reason why we need saccos with operational paybill numbers.
                 We are trying to ensure that you get the best and your customers also get the best out of our platform.
